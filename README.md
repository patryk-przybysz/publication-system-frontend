# Publication System Frontend

A React frontend application for the digital publishing platform. This client application provides a user-friendly interface for article submission, user management, and demonstrates Role-Based and Attribute-Based Access Control interactions with the backend API.

This project was originally designed and implemented by our team as part of an academic initiative at **Gdańsk University of Technology**, within the course **_Introduction to Cybersecurity_**. It serves as the frontend companion to our Publication System API, showcasing real-world applications of **RBAC** and **ABAC** access control models.
