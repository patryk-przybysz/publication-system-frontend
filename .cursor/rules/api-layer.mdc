## Use a Single Instance of the API Client

We use a single instance of the API client that has been pre-configured. 

[api-client.ts](mdc:src/lib/api-client.ts)

Rather than declaring API requests on the fly, it is recommended to define and export them separately.

Declaring API requests in a structured manner can help maintain a clean and organized codebase as everything is colocated.
Every API request declaration should consist of:

- Types and validation schemas for the request and response data
- A fetcher function that calls an endpoint, using the API client instance
- A hook that consumes the fetcher function that is built on top of `Tanstack Query` to manage the data fetching and caching logic. Follow the guidelines outlined in [data-fetching.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/data-fetching.mdc).

This approach simplifies the tracking of defined endpoints available in the application. Additionally, typing the responses and inferring them further down the application enhances application type safety.
